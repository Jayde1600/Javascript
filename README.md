Variables:

1.) Variable Definition: A variable in JavaScript is a container that holds data values. Variables allow you to store, update, and manipulate information throughout your code.

2.) Declaring Variables: Each has different characteristics regarding scope and mutability.
var: Has function scope and can be redeclared.
let: Has block scope and can be reassigned but not redeclared within the same scope.
const: Also has block scope, but it cannot be reassigned or redeclared, making it ideal for values that should not change.

3.) Data Types:
Data types in JavaScript define the type of data that a variable can hold. Understanding these types is key to performing correct operations on variables and avoiding errors.

Common Data Types:

Numbers: Used for numeric values (e.g., integers and floating-point numbers).
Strings: A sequence of characters used to represent text.
Booleans: Represents true or false, typically used in conditions and logical operations.
Arrays: A list of values, which can be of any data type, stored in a single variable.
Objects: Complex data structures that can hold multiple values and functions (methods) as properties.

4.) Data Usage: The console.log statements demonstrate how these variables can be used to output their values, illustrating the flexibility of JavaScript variables in handling various types of data.

Operators:

5.) Operators Definition: Operators are symbols or keywords used to perform operations on values (operands). They are the building blocks of expressions in JavaScript.

6.) Types of Operators: Arithmetic Operators: Used for mathematical calculations.
Examples: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus), and ** (exponentiation).

7.) Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables. Examples: = (assign), += (add and assign), -= (subtract and assign), *= (multiply and assign), /= (divide and assign).

8.) Comparison Operators: Used to compare values and return a boolean (true or false). Examples: == (equal), != (not equal), === (strict equal), !== (strict not equal), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to).

9.) Logical Operators: Used to combine multiple conditions. Examples: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT).

10.) Unary Operators: Operate on a single operand. Examples: ++ (increment), -- (decrement), typeof (type of operand).

11.) Ternary Operator: A shorthand for an if-else statement.
Example: condition ? expression1 : expression2.
