Variables:

1.) Variable Definition: A variable in JavaScript is a container that holds data values. Variables allow you to store, update, and manipulate information throughout your code.

2.) Declaring Variables: Each has different characteristics regarding scope and mutability.
var: Has function scope and can be redeclared.
let: Has block scope and can be reassigned but not redeclared within the same scope.
const: Also has block scope, but it cannot be reassigned or redeclared, making it ideal for values that should not change.

3.) Data Types:
Data types in JavaScript define the type of data that a variable can hold. Understanding these types is key to performing correct operations on variables and avoiding errors.

Common Data Types:

Numbers: Used for numeric values (e.g., integers and floating-point numbers).
Strings: A sequence of characters used to represent text.
Booleans: Represents true or false, typically used in conditions and logical operations.
Arrays: A list of values, which can be of any data type, stored in a single variable.
Objects: Complex data structures that can hold multiple values and functions (methods) as properties.

4.) Data Usage: The console.log statements demonstrate how these variables can be used to output their values, illustrating the flexibility of JavaScript variables in handling various types of data.
